An update on my Revlon fundraising&#8230; Over the last few days I&#8217;ve gotten contributions from [Kimberli](kimberlinewyork.blogspot.com) and Carla, bringing my grand total to $110! That means I&#8217;ll be giving away fabulous raffle prizes to at least 2 of my sponsors! So far I&#8217;ve talked about spinning and sweets. So let&#8217;s talk socks!
  
I think we&#8217;ve established that I have a lot of sock yarn. Especially for someone who has knitted, so far, a single pair of socks (for sockapalooza!)
  
I have these:

And I&#8217;ve also got this koigu which was previously destined for a Clapotis but is now just plain old &#8216;sock yarn&#8217; (if you can call anything this gorgeous &#8216;plain&#8217;):

If one of the lucky winners chooses the Sock Prize, I will give them:
  
&#8211; Two socks worth of any of my sock yarn (personally, I&#8217;d choose the Koigu, but I also have some Sockotta, Lornas&#8217; Laces Shepherd, Lana Grossa, and Swizzle)
  
&#8211; One set of Lantern Moon DPN&#8217;s in an appropriate size to create socks with the chosen yarn
  
&#8211; One sock book &#8211; &#8216;Knit Socks&#8217; or &#8216;Cool Socks Warm Feet&#8217;
  
A fabulous prize for any sock knitter, be they newbie or pro. If it speaks to you, click the &#8216;sponsor me&#8217; link in the right hand sidebar and throw some money in the ring. Again, each dollar will get you a virtual raffle ticket and I&#8217;ll give prizes based on the total amount donated, as well as donating 10% of my total to a couple of my fellow runners.
  
Now, I&#8217;m running out of ideas, so let me know what kind of thing you would want if you could have some kind of goody that you wouldn&#8217;t buy for yourself. That&#8217;s the best kind of prize, in my mind.
  
And in actual knitting news, the moebius is still chugging along. I think I&#8217;ll need to get one more color to make this thing complete, but I&#8217;m pretty jazzed about how it looks so far. Despite the fact that it&#8217;s all scrunched up on the teenytiny 40&#8243; circular.
  
I almost forgot to mention &#8211; my sockapalooza pal got her socks! And she liked them! And they fit! Very exciting ðŸ™‚
