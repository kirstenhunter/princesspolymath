Ok, I know, I&#8217;ve been a bad blogger. After the Revlon Run/Walk I came back to a huge pile of work to do and tons of angst in my personal life. Let me sum up&#8230; I don&#8217;t like change. Change is swirling about, causing me much internal anguish. Fortunately it seems like it&#8217;s calming now. Perhaps on another day I will expound on the issues in my children&#8217;s school and the inevitable political battles raging at the martial arts studio, but today I have something more important to do.
  
It&#8217;s time for me to do the raffle. I said I&#8217;d do a raffle and it looks like all of the donations are in, so here we go! I made over $400 so there will be (drum roll please&#8230;) \*5\* prizes! The knit blogging community never fails to astound me with its generousity &#8211; thanks to each of you who contributed to my effort (or that of the other walkers). Enough sappy stuff, let&#8217;s get to the loot! But how does one make random numbers? Yes, yes, I AM an engineer. But I am a lazy engineer and it&#8217;s Friday evening so you&#8217;ll forgive me if I don&#8217;t feel like churning out some handy randomization code. Thank heavens for google. I searched on &#8216;random raffle program&#8217; and what did I find? Of course. [random.org](http://www.random.org). Pretty obvious, now that I think about it.
  
I have a list of people all ready, and now I&#8217;m going to make numbers! So according to the random number generator, the winners, in order are:
  
1) [Kimberli](www.kimberlinewyork.blogspot.com)
  
2) [Elizabeth](www.threeolivemartini.blogspot.com)
  
3) [Danielle](http://poeticpurl.blogspot.com)
  
4) [Lucia](http://knit4ever.blogspot.com)
  
5) [La](http://www.knottygirls.com/jenlablog/)
  
I&#8217;ll send an email out shortly to the winners and see what they want. Remember, you can choose from [Spinning](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2005/04/happy_friday.html), [Socks](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2005/04/lets_talk_socks.html), [Sweets](http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2005/04/this_ones_for_y.html), or Surprise! The prizes will be filled in the order they were drawn in case of conflicts&#8230;
  
So, tell me, what do you want?
  
In knitting news, my fixation socks are coming along slowly. Now that my life isn&#8217;t so crazy I should be able to make more progress on them. I&#8217;m thinking seriously of joining the [Just For Me](http://justformakal2005.bravehost.com/) knitalong, although the very notion of knitting something that I will wear is a little dizzying. I&#8217;d make my tank top out of that luscious Lily yarn I have hanging around upstairs. Of course my cat would have to live without his bed for a bit longer and then I&#8217;d feel silly for having worked so hard to get the needle&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t have to decide right this minute.
  
Sorry for the lack of pictures, but at least there&#8217;s good loot to be had!
