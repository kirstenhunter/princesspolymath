On June 7, I gave a presentation to the [Semantic Web Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Semantic-Web-Meetup/events/16940644/) in San Francisco on using LinkedIn&#8217;s Faceted Search.  The [presentation](/assets/img/2011/06/semantic-Presentation.pdf) talked about using the Faceted Search capabilities of LinkedIn&#8217;s Search API to create a semantic browsing experience within an application.  This topic is explored in much more depth in a [previous post](http://www.princesspolymath.com/princess_polymath/?p=404) on this blog, which has all the code and logic needed to make it work for you.

More information on the LinkedIn APIs can be found on the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](http://developer.linkedin.com).

Let me know if you have questions or thoughts, and I&#8217;ll make sure you get what you need!
