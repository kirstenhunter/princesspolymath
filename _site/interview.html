	<meta name="description" content="I found this over at Three Olive Martini and figured it was a good way to avoid talking about the Sockapalooza sock. Below is the description of what is going on along with the questions and answers.

First let’s get the description out of the way.

Here are the rules for this Blog-a-thon. I’ll offer to interview the next how many ever people to respond to this post that will follow these rules:


  
    Leave me a comment saying “interview me.”
  
  
    I will respond by asking you five questions here. They will be different questions than the ones below.
  
  
    You will update YOUR blog with the answers to the questions.
  
  
    You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the same post.
  
  
    When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions.
  


Ok…here are the questions that Three Olive Martini asked of me:

&amp;lt;font color=blue&amp;gt;1. Why are you dragging ass on that sock? (lol)&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;

Oh, cr*p! I was hoping to avoid talking about the sock! Actually the sock is done, except for the toe. I transferred it to 2 of my backup needles and cast on for the other sock, figuring I would have a Kitchener stitch party once they’re both ready. I’m mostly dragging ass because I’ve been busy doing the updates for my friend and I was working on Sherbet, and my kids keep taking up my time, and, and… ok, no good reason, really 🙂

I will have pictures up of the socks when they’re done, I’ll have my dainty-footed daughter try them on (her feet are not really dainty – they’re basically women’s size 7 feet on a 7 year old!)

&amp;lt;font color=blue&amp;gt;2. I have seen your mom’s chair…its fabulous! Did you get any of that kind of talent for painting or do you have other talents you inherited from her or any one else?&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;

Sadly, no, I did not get the talent for art from my mother. It skipped my generation (I got my father’s artistic talent, which lags significantly behind that of my mother). My daughter, who is 7, has lots and lots of talent. I’m more of a left-brainer, myself. I write software. Although recently I have given some thought to  writing (scroll down to the bottom for the first chapter in my romance novel) and I’m enjoying my newfound fun knitting talent. Actually the one talent I really seem to have is that I’m good at learning anything quickly – tap dancing, martial arts, knitting… And clearly I am very talented at answering questions concisely. Or not.

3. Do you think Martha Stewart was unjustly sentenced to prison? Explain.

No. I don’t think she meant to be evil, she was trying to cover up which is a very human thing to do, but alas, if you lie to people under oath it’s perjury. If anyone else had done the same thing, they’d have been sent prison, so it’s only fair.

4.What is your favourite thing to cook ?

Oh, that’s a hard question. I love to cook and bake all sorts of things. Hmm… let’s see. My current favorite thing to *bake* is my ginger-molasses cookies, because everyone makes yummy sounds when they eat them. My favorite food to *cook* is meatloaf, LOL. Everyone in the family likes it and it’s got kind of a mud-pie sensibility in the making of it. I also love making chicken-and-dumplings for comfort reasons.

5. If you had to choose one item to have with you the rest of your life what would it be? 

What a hard question! I tried and tried to come up with a real answer but I just couldn’t. So I’m going to go with a cop-out answer… inner peace. Seriously, I spend my whole life striving for zen mastery but I have made so little progress that I don’t think I’ll make it there until I’m about 942 years old.">

			<p>I found this over at <a href="http://threeolivemartini.blogspot.com/">Three Olive Martini</a> and figured it was a good way to avoid talking about the Sockapalooza sock. Below is the description of what is going on along with the questions and answers.</p>

<p>First let’s get the description out of the way.</p>

<p>Here are the rules for this Blog-a-thon. I’ll offer to interview the next how many ever people to respond to this post that will follow these rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li>

</ol>

<p>Ok…here are the questions that Three Olive Martini asked of me:</p>

<p>&lt;font color=blue&gt;1. Why are you dragging ass on that sock? (lol)&lt;/font&gt;</p>

<p>Oh, cr*p! I was hoping to avoid talking about the sock! Actually the sock is done, except for the toe. I transferred it to 2 of my backup needles and cast on for the other sock, figuring I would have a Kitchener stitch party once they’re both ready. I’m mostly dragging ass because I’ve been busy doing the updates for my <a href="http://susanupdates.domestigirl.com">friend</a> and I was working on Sherbet, and my kids keep taking up my time, and, and… ok, no good reason, really 🙂</p>

<p>I will have pictures up of the socks when they’re done, I’ll have my dainty-footed daughter try them on (her feet are not really dainty – they’re basically women’s size 7 feet on a 7 year old!)</p>

<p>&lt;font color=blue&gt;2. I have seen your mom’s chair…its fabulous! Did you get any of that kind of talent for painting or do you have other talents you inherited from her or any one else?&lt;/font&gt;</p>

<p>Sadly, no, I did not get the talent for art from my mother. It skipped my generation (I got my father’s artistic talent, which lags significantly behind that of my mother). My daughter, who is 7, has lots and lots of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/synedra/PhotoAlbum1.html">talent</a>. I’m more of a left-brainer, myself. I write software. Although recently I have given some thought to  <a href="http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2005/01/books.html">writing</a> (scroll down to the bottom for the first chapter in my romance novel) and I’m enjoying my newfound fun knitting talent. Actually the one talent I really seem to have is that I’m good at learning anything quickly – tap dancing, martial arts, knitting… And clearly I am very talented at answering questions concisely.
