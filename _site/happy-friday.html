	<meta name="description" content="Well, I had a post all ready to go and my browser took a dive, hmph. Ah well. Second timeâ€™s the charm, I guess!

Still working hard on my moebius thing, so Iâ€™ll take this opportunity to thank those wonderful folks who have already sponsored me for the Revlon Run/Walk. Many thanks to Lu, Michelle and Kathy! Iâ€™m up to $40 now which is very exciting ðŸ™‚

Iâ€™m now going to whet your appetites with some lovely fiber porn, hoping to entice even more of you to contribute. As I said, the winners of this raffle will get to pick the type of prize they want (spinning, knitting, books, sweet treats) â€“ or take the â€˜surprise meâ€™ option.

Today Iâ€™m going to talk about the spinning option! When I was at Stitches West I got some great roving and a spindle, but havenâ€™t had time to work on my spinning. It seems a shame that this fabulous roving isnâ€™t being fondled regularly by anyone, so Iâ€™ll be happy to pass it along to a lucky winner.

The Spinning Prize will include:

(1) nice wooden drop spindle and (1) brochure with spinning instructions



(1) hank of merino/tencel roving from Deep Color. I canâ€™t even begin to describe how incredibly yummy this stuff feels and looks. Iâ€™ve heard that it spins up just like butter and I can totally believe it. Seriously, look me straight in the eye and tell me these photos donâ€™t start your salivary glands up.

You can pick either of the two colors I have:

purpleâ€¦



or tealâ€¦



hereâ€™s the money shot with both of them



So come on! Who could possibly resist all that shimmery wool, intertwined together on the floor? Sponsor me and win some yummy rovingâ€¦

Iâ€™ll leave you with some random thoughts for those folks finding me through interesting search engine searches:

For those of you searching on â€˜koigu clapotisâ€™ and â€˜clapotis fingeringâ€™, let me just warn you that many a knitter has run out of steam about 2/3 of the way through when using teeny tiny yarn. On the other hand Iâ€™ve seen some incredibly beautiful ones so itâ€™s up to you. I havenâ€™t started mine yetâ€¦

Whoever searched on â€˜SUSHI +WASHCLOTH -EAT -RICE +CUTEâ€™ Iâ€™m pretty certain you didnâ€™t find what you were looking for here. I hope you found your cute sushi washcloths somewhere! Iâ€™d like to see those, actually.

â€˜silk &amp;amp; seagrass drawstring boxâ€™ and â€˜lantern moon drawstring boxâ€™ â€“ yes, I have one of those!





And, strangely, someone found me by searching on â€˜grumpyâ€™. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m that grumpy, do you?">
