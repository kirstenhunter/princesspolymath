	<meta name="description" content="Ok, I know, I’ve been a bad blogger. After the Revlon Run/Walk I came back to a huge pile of work to do and tons of angst in my personal life. Let me sum up… I don’t like change. Change is swirling about, causing me much internal anguish. Fortunately it seems like it’s calming now. Perhaps on another day I will expound on the issues in my children’s school and the inevitable political battles raging at the martial arts studio, but today I have something more important to do.

It’s time for me to do the raffle. I said I’d do a raffle and it looks like all of the donations are in, so here we go! I made over $400 so there will be (drum roll please…) *5* prizes! The knit blogging community never fails to astound me with its generousity – thanks to each of you who contributed to my effort (or that of the other walkers). Enough sappy stuff, let’s get to the loot! But how does one make random numbers? Yes, yes, I AM an engineer. But I am a lazy engineer and it’s Friday evening so you’ll forgive me if I don’t feel like churning out some handy randomization code. Thank heavens for google. I searched on ‘random raffle program’ and what did I find? Of course. random.org. Pretty obvious, now that I think about it.

I have a list of people all ready, and now I’m going to make numbers! So according to the random number generator, the winners, in order are:

1) Kimberli

2) Elizabeth

3) Danielle

4) Lucia

5) La

I’ll send an email out shortly to the winners and see what they want. Remember, you can choose from Spinning, Socks, Sweets, or Surprise! The prizes will be filled in the order they were drawn in case of conflicts…

So, tell me, what do you want?

In knitting news, my fixation socks are coming along slowly. Now that my life isn’t so crazy I should be able to make more progress on them. I’m thinking seriously of joining the Just For Me knitalong, although the very notion of knitting something that I will wear is a little dizzying. I’d make my tank top out of that luscious Lily yarn I have hanging around upstairs. Of course my cat would have to live without his bed for a bit longer and then I’d feel silly for having worked so hard to get the needle… well, I don’t have to decide right this minute.

Sorry for the lack of pictures, but at least there’s good loot to be had!">
