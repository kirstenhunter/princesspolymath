	<meta name="description" content="Yes, itâ€™s trueâ€¦ *sigh* Iâ€™ve become one of those once-a-month-whether-I-need-it-or-not bloggers. Alas. I donâ€™t even have any new excuses â€“ entropy and chaos have had me in their inescapable grasp for most of 2005. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel! It looks like I may be heading into a calmer 2006â€¦

In any case, hereâ€™s my update on all the recent chaos in my life. Iâ€™ve already discussed the selling of the house and moving across the county, so Iâ€™m gonna have to come up with some new interesting topics to keep my readers awake.

Cheerleading: I know, itâ€™s not really new. But driving V back and forth to practices and games eats up a lot of my time, so itâ€™s worth mentioning. Plus the only picture I have available for this entry is Victoria cheering. This weekend we had a game on Saturday (we won) and a cheer competition on Sunday (the girls came in 3rd out of 16, and I am so proud of all of them!)



Job: I believe I mentioned that I was looking for a new job, and I am happy to report that as of Monday I will be spending my geeky working hours in the service of SocialText. Itâ€™s a fantastic opportunity to work with some of the smartest folks in my particular geeky industry and Iâ€™m really excited.

School: Yet again, the boy was having some issues with the kidsâ€™ school. So we moved them to a new school, 5 minutes from our house, and weâ€™re thrilled with the change. For those of you familiar with the D&amp;amp;D millieu, the school we had them at before was heavy into â€˜Lawâ€™ â€“ These Are The Rules and now Letâ€™s Apply Them. My boy was in the office every day for a new transgression and seriously stressed all the time. The new school is, I would say, solidly Chaotic Good. Each kid has their own learning plan and goals, and they are very adaptable â€“ my boy is thriving, as is my girl. Did I mention thrilled? Oh, and for those of you who understand the Law/Chaos division and need somewhere to waste valuable time, please check out Order of the Stick. Go on, Iâ€™ll wait.

Susan: No, sheâ€™s not chaotic ðŸ™‚ I just wanted to update anyone interested and tell you all that sheâ€™s doing great! Sheâ€™s learning to walk again, working a couple days a week, and really looking and feeling like a regular person again.">
