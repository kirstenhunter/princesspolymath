	<meta name="description" content="Well Iâ€™ve been an absent blogger because every free minute has been consumed by trying to finish the socks on time. Unfortunately, today is the 15th and the socks didnâ€™t go out. Yet. Theyâ€™re well underway, though:



I hope to finish in a couple of days and then send them off. Yes, I know that I have to finish the toe on the first one, but I figured Iâ€™d do them at the same time.

My pal sent me my socks, though, and theyâ€™re wonderful!



They fit *perfectly*, as you can see, and they are comfortable and beautiful. I love them lots.

I got another couple of reciprocal interview questions, and since I know youâ€™re all dying to know more about me Iâ€™ll answer them now:

La of JenLa asked these most excellent questions:

1. What advice would you give a new telecommuter to keep him from going entirely stir-crazy the way of The Shining and taking his whole family with him?

Itâ€™s hard to say. Certain people are just ok with telecommuting and other people need to interact with people. But I do interact with people. My day usually looks like this: Get up, get ready, kick the kids outta bed, go downstairs and start breakfast/lunches, check email and cases, finish getting the kids ready, take kids to school and chat a bit with the other moms, go to Starbucks for iced tea, come home, work for a couple of hours, go eat lunch with someoneâ€¦ you get the idea. I probably work 45-50 hours most weeks, but not all in a *row* so I have time to go see people. Sometimes I work from Starbucks or Borders just to scratch the â€˜be around other peopleâ€™ itch. Iâ€™m super productive because I donâ€™t go to meetings, and my boss thinks Iâ€™m great. If my kids werenâ€™t in school and my husband didnâ€™t have his own office Iâ€™d probably become an axe murderer.

&amp;lt;font color= purple &amp;gt;2. How far have you gotten on your novel? Can you give us a teaser?&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;

I threw the first chapter of my book in this entry. Sadly, I havenâ€™t had the time (or made the time) to get more done. Yet.

&amp;lt;font color= purple &amp;gt;3. What is a lap band? Were you satisfied with your results?&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;

The lap band is a minimally invasive weight loss surgery. Thereâ€™s lots of info about it on my lap band site, but basically itâ€™s like a little adjustable watch band around the top of your stomach making a little pouch so you get full faster. I lost over 100 pounds â€“ I gained some of it back after I got an infection from my tummy tuck, so Iâ€™m at about 80 pounds now, but I am very satisfied with my results even so. Iâ€™m even happy with the tummy tuck but I wonâ€™t show you those before/after pictures unless you really wanna see them.

&amp;lt;font color= purple &amp;gt;4. What has been your favorite project thus far?&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;

I loved making Sherbet, that was very fun. And it looks so great on Kaily, so it was very gratifying ðŸ™‚

&amp;lt;font color= purple &amp;gt;5. If you could have any super-power you wanted what would it be and why?&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;

Well, flying of course. Does anyone ever pick anything different? I would love to be able to see the world from above.

And Terby asked me these questions:

1) What made you decide to do your first triathlon?

My friend talked me into it. I had only had my lap band for a year and was trying to really commit to consistent training. I do much better when Iâ€™m training for a goal so it worked out well. It was super fun, too ðŸ™‚

2) If you could take lessons from any chef, alive or dead, whom would you choose?

Iâ€™d love to learn from Alton Brown. Heâ€™s such a food geek and understands the *why* of everything, which is fascinating to me.

3) Where would you go on your dream vacation?

I would go back to Cozumel or Hawaii. I love diving and both places were amazingly relaxing and nice to see. Iâ€™d also love to go to New Zealand or Fiji someday.

4) What question do you wish I had asked?

What are we doing for the kidsâ€™ spring break? Weâ€™re going to Disneyland! We went when the Girl turned 2, 4, and 6â€¦ now sheâ€™s turning 8. So we have no choice, you see!

5) Egyptian theme Fry&amp;#8217;s or Western theme? Discuss.

I like the Egyptian themeâ€¦ Iâ€™m more fond of the look, personally (love the Rosicrucian museum!) plus the layout of the other Fryâ€™s annoys me.">

			<p>Well Iâ€™ve been an absent blogger because every free minute has been consumed by trying to finish the socks on time. Unfortunately, today is the 15th and the socks didnâ€™t go out. Yet. Theyâ€™re well underway, though:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/images/stripesocks.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I hope to finish in a couple of days and then send them off. Yes, I know that I have to finish the toe on the first one, but I figured Iâ€™d do them at the same time.</p>

<p>My pal sent me my socks, though, and theyâ€™re wonderful!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/images/palsocks.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>They fit *perfectly*, as you can see, and they are comfortable and beautiful. I love them lots.</p>

<p>I got another couple of reciprocal interview questions, and since I know youâ€™re all dying to know more about me Iâ€™ll answer them now:</p>

<p>La of <a href="http://knottygirls.com/jenlablog/index.php">JenLa</a> asked these most excellent questions:</p>

<font color="purple">1. What advice would you give a new telecommuter to keep him from going <del>entirely stir-crazy </del>the way of <em>The Shining </em>and taking his whole family with him?</font>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to say. Certain people are just ok with telecommuting and other people need to interact with people. But I do interact with people. My day usually looks like this: Get up, get ready, kick the kids outta bed, go downstairs and start breakfast/lunches, check email and cases, finish getting the kids ready, take kids to school and chat a bit with the other moms, go to Starbucks for iced tea, come home, work for a couple of hours, go eat lunch with someoneâ€¦ you get the idea. I probably work 45-50 hours most weeks, but not all in a *row* so I have time to go see people. Sometimes I work from Starbucks or Borders just to scratch the â€˜be around other peopleâ€™ itch. Iâ€™m super productive because I donâ€™t go to meetings, and my boss thinks Iâ€™m great. If my kids werenâ€™t in school and my husband didnâ€™t have his own office Iâ€™d probably become an axe murderer.</p>

<p>&lt;font color= purple &gt;2. How far have you gotten on your novel? Can you give us a teaser?&lt;/font&gt;</p>

<p>I threw the first chapter of my book in <a href="http://www.perlgoddess.com/blog/archives/2005/01/books.html">this entry</a>. Sadly, I havenâ€™t had the time (or made the time) to get more done. Yet.</p>

<p>&lt;font color= purple &gt;3. What is a lap band? Were you satisfied with your results?&lt;/font&gt;</p>

<p>The lap band is a minimally invasive weight loss surgery. Thereâ€™s lots of info about it on my <a href="http://www.rawbw.com/~kirsten/">lap band site</a>, but basically itâ€™s like a little adjustable watch band around the top of your stomach making a little pouch so you get full faster. I lost over 100 pounds â€“ I gained some of it back after I got an infection from my tummy tuck, so Iâ€™m at about 80 pounds now, but I am very satisfied with my results even so. Iâ€™m even happy with the tummy tuck but I wonâ€™t show you those before/after pictures unless you really wanna see them.</p>

<p>&lt;font color= purple &gt;4. What has been your favorite project thus far?&lt;/font&gt;</p>

<p>I loved making Sherbet, that was very fun. And it looks so great on Kaily, so it was very gratifying ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>&lt;font color= purple &gt;5. If you could have any super-power you wanted what would it be and why?&lt;/font&gt;</p>

<p>Well, flying of course. Does anyone ever pick anything different? I would love to be able to see the world from above.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.terbyknits.blogspot.com/">Terby</a> asked me these questions:</p>

<font color="green">1) What made you decide to do your first triathlon?</font>

<p>My <a href="http://www.bumblebeefitness.com">friend</a> talked me into it. I had only had my lap band for a year and was trying to really commit to consistent training. I do much better when Iâ€™m training for a goal so it worked out well. It was super fun, too ðŸ™‚</p>

<font color="green">2) If you could take lessons from any chef, alive or dead, whom would you choose?</font>

<p>Iâ€™d love to learn from Alton Brown. Heâ€™s such a food geek and understands the *why* of everything, which is fascinating to me.</p>

<font color="green">3) Where would you go on your dream vacation?</font>

<p>I would go back to Cozumel or Hawaii. I love diving and both places were amazingly relaxing and nice to see. Iâ€™d also love to go to New Zealand or Fiji someday.</p>

<font color="green">4) What question do you wish I had asked?</font>

<p>What are we doing for the kidsâ€™ spring break? Weâ€™re going to Disneyland! We went when the Girl turned 2, 4, and 6â€¦ now sheâ€™s turning 8. So we have no choice, you see!</p>

<font color="green">5) Egyptian theme Fry&#8217;s or Western theme? Discuss.</font>

<p>I like the Egyptian themeâ€¦ Iâ€™m more fond of the look, personally (love the Rosicrucian museum!) plus the layout of the other Fryâ€™s annoys me.</p>
